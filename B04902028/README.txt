How to run:
Use make to run Makefile to get a compiled file named "puts".
./puts and input in order of S (stock price at time 0), X (strike price), t (maturity in years), s (%) (annual volatility), r (%) (continuously compounded annual interest rate), and n (number of periods)
and get the output in order of american puts ; european puts.
I print it like american:2.324598 ; european:2.202804.
